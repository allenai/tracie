event: But academic researchers and scientists at companies like Microsoft , I.B.M. and Hewlett - Packard working to develop quantum computers starts before Lockheed Martin which bought an early version of such a computer from the Canadian company D - Wave Systems two years ago becoming the first company to use quantum computing as part of its business story: Our digital age is all about bits , those precise ones and zeros that are the stuff of modern computer code . But a powerful new type of computer that is about to be commercially deployed by a major American military contractor is taking computing into the strange , subatomic realm of quantum mechanics . In that infinitesimal neighborhood , common sense logic no longer seems to apply . A one can be a one , or it can be a one and a zero and everything in between   all at the same time . It sounds preposterous , particularly to those familiar with the yes / no world of conventional computing .

event: President Barack Obama arrived in refugee - flooded Jordan on Friday after scoring a diplomatic coup just before leaving Israel when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to Turkey for a 2010 commando raid that killed nine activists on a Turkish vessel in a Gaza - bound flotilla starts after President Barack Obama scoring a diplomatic coup just before leaving Israel when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to Turkey for a 2010 commando raid that killed nine activists on a Turkish vessel in a Gaza - bound flotilla story: President Barack Obama  arrived in refugee - flooded Jordan on Friday after  scoring a diplomatic coup just before leaving Israel when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to Turkey for a 2010 commando raid that killed nine activists on a Turkish vessel in a Gaza - bound flotilla . The apology , long sought by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan , eased strained feelings between Turkey and Israel , two vital U.S. allies in the Middle East . It happened in a phone call to Erdogan during a final meeting between Obama and Netanyahu at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv minutes before Air Force One departed for Jordan to complete the president 's Middle East swing . It is the first foreign trip of his second term . A statement from Netanyahu 's office said the apology included an offer of compensation . However , there was confusion later when the Israeli government dropped a reference in its original statement to normalized relations between the countries with a return of ambassadors . There also was no word on whether the once - close nations would resume the joint military exercises that were suspended after the flotilla raid . Turkey had been prosecuting four Israeli soldiers in absentia and Israel initially said the two leaders agreed to the cancellation of legal steps against the troops . Later , however , its amended statement omitted that action as well . 	answer: positive

event: documenting human rights abuses in Russia starts before The US embassy in Moscow voiced concern story: Russian police and tax inspectors have raided the offices of the human rights group Memorial and other civil society groups which get foreign funding . Memorial is famous for  documenting human rights abuses in Russia . The US embassy in Moscow has  voiced concern and asked the Russian government for an explanation . A new Russian law says foreign - funded non - governmental groups ( NGOs ) linked to politics must register as " foreign agents " - a term which suggests spying . In the worst repressions of the Soviet period the label " foreign agents " was used to denounce dissidents - or simply political rivals of Joseph Stalin - and could lead to execution . Memorial says inspectors returned to its Moscow offices on Friday , having already seized 600 documents including accounts on Thursday . A statement on the Memorial website said the inspections were directly linked to the new law on NGOs and the targeted groups ' compliance with it . Memorial director Arseny Roginsky , quoted by the Russian news website Vesti , said it was " a complete check on everything concerned with our sources of funding " . He insisted that the NGO law " will not change our position at all " . " We wo n't refuse foreign donations , nor will we register as a ' foreign agent ' , " he said . 	answer: positive
